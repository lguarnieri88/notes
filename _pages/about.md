Hi, I’m Leandro, a mathematician, father, Data Scientist, amateur cook and compulsive reader among other things. I’m from Argentina but have been living in Mexico the last few years. 

After a very short academic career I started working in Data Science and haven’t looked back since. Today I enjoy using math as a way to solve real world problems and as a source of ideas.

This site is the place where I drop my personal notes on the things I find  interesting. Expect notes about books, math, leading teams, parenting, cooking and creativity in general. Notes are in a perennial state of work in progress and change over time.

If you find anything of interest or want to comment on anything, feel free to reach out.
