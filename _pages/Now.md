#Now

## January - 2023

My son is starting to read, so I’m having fun helping him do that and also convincing him that 2 + 3 = 3 + 2. In the last few months he’s also started “playing” chess (in the sense that he now knows how to move the pieces) so I’ll be trying to see if he goes on to make some progress with chess as well.

I have taken up clarinet after several years of my first failed attempt so I’m excited to see how that goes.

To keep learning new things, I’m going back to programming in Julia. I have looked at it in the past and done a few things, but I haven’t used it intensively, so I’ll be trying to do ML stuff with it and post the results here.

Workwise, we’re still building [Algorithia](https://www.algorithia.com/) into a leading Advanced Analytics company and designing new solutions that add great value to our clients.

As with the start of every year, I’m not particularly sure what my reading journey will be like, but it will probably come out of [[Book wishlist]]
