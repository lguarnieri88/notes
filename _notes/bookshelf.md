### My Bookshelf

This are the books I’ve been reading, my comments and rating. Some of them have specific notes, which range between random thoughts and incomplete summaries.

The rating can be loosely interpreted as:
5: Will read again, recommend unconditionally
4: Great book, definitely recommended
3: Good, recommended if you are interested in the topic.
2: Did not enjoy it.
1: Actively avoid.

*Magritte: A Life* - 4 -
Biography of the surrealist painter. I greatly enjoyed the discussions on his paintings, motives and influences, but it is a bit long and would only recommend it for those interested in Magritte. 

*The Baron in the trees* - 3 - 
Not my favorite Calvino by a long stretch. A novel about a young man that decides one day to climb up a tree and live without going back to the ground for the rest of his life.
I enjoyed the idea of the unapologetic young man that keeps true to himself till the end, but little else. Some of the episodes throughout were ok, but I don’t think I’ll be going back.

*Storytelling with data* - 4 -
Great book about how to communicate better with data. From the basics of which charts to use for what and the importance of communicating through  a story, it’s a great place to start in Data Visualization. Very pragmatic and with examples that one can apply immediately to real time situations. It doesn’t go too deep on the different topics though, and references other books and resources to further look into. 

*The Witness (El entenado) - JJ Saer - 3*  - [[El entenado]]
A man in his eighties, living in XVth century Spain writes about his experience living ten years among the Indians in America. Half adventure book, half philosophical treaty, written in beautiful prose and dealing with perception, memory and reality. Made me think of Gulliver’s Travels throughout. I loved it but it does get a bit heavy at points.
