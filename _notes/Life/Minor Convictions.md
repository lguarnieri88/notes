Title: Minor Convictions
---

These are things I don’t necessarily do with the regularity I’d wish, but that make me feel good. 

* Get out of the city once a month
* Reach out to a person I haven’t spoken to in a while
* Cook a new recipe once a week
* Take one picture every day and build an album for the year. 
* Have a living thing at home. I don’t have pets, so this means having plants or flowers.
