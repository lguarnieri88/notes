Title: Reading Rules
---

Some of the rules I follow for reading. Most of them are thought to encourage as varied a reading list as possible every year ( Because [[Specialization is for insects]] ).

By this point I don’t have to think of them anymore, but It can’t hurt to have them written down:

* Never read more than two consecutive books in the same language. (Almost out of use)
* Every year read:
	* a classic
	* books from at least three different centuries
	* a short story collection
	* a biography
	* at leas one book you had already read ([[Rereading policy]])
	* a book about reading
	* a book about writing
