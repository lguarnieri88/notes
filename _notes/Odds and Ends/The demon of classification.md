Sometimes an image makes an argument better than any logic could. Case in point:

> Take the beetles, for instance… In London there was a scientist writing a book on beetles, and when it was finished with every beetle in the world classified, he took it the the publishers’. But on the way to the publishers’ a little black beetle crossed his path that he had never seen before, that didn’t fit into any classification! He quickly put out his foot, squashed the beetle, grinding it into the sidewalk so that it existed no longer. This is the danger of classification.
