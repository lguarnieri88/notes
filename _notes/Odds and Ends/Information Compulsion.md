# Information Compulsion
#Zettelkasten #publish

The world, Tom Wolfe said, is full of people with “information compulsion”, that can’t wait to tell you their stories. 

The good side of it is that you get to hear stories and things that you wouldn’t have dreamt of asking about. 

The bad side is that it applies to you as well. Many times one feels compelled to comment on something or fill in a silence saying something that one regrets afterwards, or that doesn’t have value other than filling that void.
