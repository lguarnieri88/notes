It is widely assumed that vision is instantaneous. Looking is not the same as seeing. Seeing something is not the same as understanding it. 

Access is not the same as learning. What turns access into learning is time and strategic patience.

We need to give students opportunity to see the formative value of time and delay (e.g. look at a painting for 3 hrs straight). The deliberate engagement of delay should be a skill to teach students.
