title: Don't do That Again
---

Charles Mingus used to shout, after a member of his band did a great solo, “Don’t do that again”.

Even in something as impossible to repeat as the solo of a jazz song, the message seems relevant. When one is rewarded so resoundingly as a musician in a Jazz Club, one will strive to repeat oneself. The problem is that you won’t be able to replicate what you did, and you will be left comparing your new experience to the past one instead of being present in the moment.  

Creation involves reinventing everything from scratch, every time.
