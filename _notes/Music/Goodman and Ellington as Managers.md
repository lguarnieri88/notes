title: Goodman and Ellington as Managers
---

Duke Ellington’s orchestra is unmatched in its longevity and quality. Much of that can be traced back to Duke’s style of management. Instead of setting a mold for the musicians to fit into, he built the ensemble on the strengths of his musicians. Many of the people in the band stayed for many years and even decades.

Benny Goodman was a perfectionist. Much more intense, and rarely satisfied with the musicians he hired. Many of his musicians were burnt out on the intensity and left the band shortly after arriving.
