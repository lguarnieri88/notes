You can increase performance by way of increasing your skills/potential or you can increase it by reducing how much you interfere with yourself.

Definitions - Self 1 is everything that interferes with your potential. Self 2 is everything that expresses your potential.

Many times, it’s not Self 1’s talk about what you should do or what could have happened, so much as the talk back to Self 1 that interferes with your performance.
