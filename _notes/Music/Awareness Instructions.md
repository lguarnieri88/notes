title: Do This and Awareness Instructions
---

You can classify instructions in two kinds.

“Do this” instructions are prescriptive. The teacher tells the student what to do. “Stand tall”, “relax your neck muscles” “put the fingers near the instrument”, etc. These have a number of problems. 

The student my not understand them, or they may contradict something that he is seeing or feeling. If many such instructions are piled on, it may be hard for the student to carry them all at once.

Awareness instructions, on the other hand, ask the student to pay attention to something in particular. For example, the placement of the fingers on the clarinet when the sound doesn’t come out. Instead of telling the student to cover all the holes, he’ll reach that conclusion by himself. 

They need not be understood, because they relate to what the student is perceiving. They can’t contradict any other instruction or perception for the same reason. They are far more effective.

The best part of all is, you can rephrase “do this” instructions as awareness instructions. Instead of saying “stand tall”, “pay attention your posture when the sound comes out right”, etc.
