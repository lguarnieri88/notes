title: How to Listen to Jazz
---

A great all-round introduction to jazz. It discusses the most common structures of the music, goes over the history of jazz and zooms in some of the biggest names. All throughout it recommends tracks to listen that illustrate the authorâ€™s points. Good entry point to the music.
