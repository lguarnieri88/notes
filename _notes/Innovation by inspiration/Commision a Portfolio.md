In order to drive the maximum potential through the funnel you have to keep your options open. Shift your mindset from “What is my answer” to “What are my answers”. Build a portfolio of ideas. Each idea has little chances of being successful, that’s why it’s important.

Next time you have a challenge, try out more than one possible solution, and iterate, to improve upon those solutions, possibly combining some of them.
