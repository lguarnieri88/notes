title: Analogous exploration
---

Analogical thinking is the ability to perceive and use relational similarities between two situations. 

Analogous exploration is a way to fill the exploration funnel that consists of brainstorming places that have solved a problem that you’re dealing with (e.g. a florist solved the problem of giving reliable delivery estimates), going there, and trying to get ideas you can then apply to your situation.

How to:
1. Brainstorm locations that have the problem you’re interested in solved (e.g. gaining trust) 
2. Choose one that’s authentic to you (e.g. a fitness place if you’re concerned about your health)
3. Visit them and experience their offering. Some tips for that are:
	1. Get in the headspace
	2. Authentically introduce your need as a customer
	3. Submit fully (don’t parallel process)
	4. Notice how they do it
	5. Capture observations immediately following
4. Extract principles from the observations. See [[Abstraction]]
5. Leverage inspiration to fuel new ideas
