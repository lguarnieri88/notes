title: Innovation by inspiration
---

A Majority of companies recognize the importance of innovation, but very few know how to manage the challenges that come along with it. 

Disruptive innovation should be dealt in a very different way than the day to day execution or even than incremental innovation.  ([[Google Innovation]])

The first very important point is to stress the fact that the innovation funnel is brutal. Only about .1% of the ideas see the light of day successfully. So to end up with one successful idea you have to start with a lot more.

Another important lesson is to start thinking in terms of portfolios and stop thinking about singular answers. Any particular idea has the smallest chance of success, but inside a portfolio you can be reasonably sure that one idea will work.

Here are 7 techniques/ideas to approach innovation and maximize chances of success:

* [[Bring Diverse Perspectives]]
* [[Framing]]
* [[Analogous exploration]]
* [[Divergent Mindset]]
* [[Embrace Distractions]]
* [[Distinctive selection criteria]]
* [[Commission a portfolio]]
