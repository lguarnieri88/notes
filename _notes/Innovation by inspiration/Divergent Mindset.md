title: Divergent Mindset
---

Convergent and divergent mindsets are very different. Convergent mindset  helps focus, but the very characteristics that help do that are the ones that hinder the creative process. Learn to shift between mindsets and when to use each one.

Three mindset shifts towards a divergent mindset:
1. Celebrate failure
2. Let go of control: let the collaboration take control, rather than any particular individual
3. Yes, and!: don’t try to negate (“no”) or worse, concede but change (“yes, but”)
