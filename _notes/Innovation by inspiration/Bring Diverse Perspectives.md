---


* HBR - Why Diverse teams are smarter
	* They focus more on facts.
	* They process facts better.
	* They innovate more.

* Consider what kind of perspective might be useful in challenging the paradigm you bring to the table, and bring someone that can contribute that perspective.
* If there are no new ideas, and every idea is a combination of already existing ones, then it pays off to have people with diverse backgrounds that can combine things differently.
