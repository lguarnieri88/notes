Things go wrong. It happens, and one should be prepared to deal with that. The four questions on a has to answer in this cases are:

* What?: What happened
* Why?: What are the causes and reasons of what happened
* How?: What are the circumstances that let that happen
* What are we going to do so that this doesn’t happen again?

The important thing here is to show up and not hide anything, just to be clear and honest about the situation and genuine in the attempt that things don’t repeat themselves.
