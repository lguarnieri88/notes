Title: How to write with Style
---

Kurt Vonnegut has this very short list of important things to bear in mind when writing. He explores each point further in his essay How to Write with Style.

Although there is no specific or formal definition, elements of style are the revelations about the author that seep through the text. So in that sense, the first place to start is to have ideas in your head and things you want to communicate. This resonates with [[Nabokov’s comments on Style]].

As for the list:
1. Find a subject you care about
2. Don’t ramble
3. Keep it simple. See also [[Several Short Sentences on Writing]]
4. Have the guts to cut things out
5. Sound like yourself, nothing worse that someone trying to sound like someone else.
6. Say what you mean to say. 
7. Pity the readers. Reading is hard enough as it is, try to make it easier on them by being clear.
