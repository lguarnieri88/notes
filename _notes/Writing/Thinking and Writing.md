title: Thinking and Writing
---

There is no such thing as thinking before you write. You write the sentences you form in your head, and in doing so you start thinking. Very much like [[The minimalist entrepreneur]] on starting a business. Allow yourself to be carried by the process of writing and discover what you’re thinking through it.

> The piece you’re writing is about what you find in the piece you’re writing.
