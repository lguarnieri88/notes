title: The link between politics and language
---

In [[Politics and the English Language]], Orwell argues that “In our time (1946), political writing is bad writing.” And declares: 

> Orthodoxy, of whatever color seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style.  

The reduced state of consciousness that comes with this use of pre made speech is necessary for political conformity.

The author argues that most of the time political speech is the defense of the indefensible. This requires the opposite of clarity. e.g. Instead of conjuring up images of people being killed, villages bombarded, and so on, it is better to speak of _pacification_.
