# A Scrupulous Writer
#Zettelkasten #publish

In [[Politics and the English Language]], George Orwell says that a scrupulous writer will ask himself four questions in every sentence he writes:

1. What am I trying to say?
2. What words will express it?
3. What image will make this clearer?
4. Is that image fresh enough to have an effect?

And after writing two more:
1. Can I say it more shortly?
2. Have I said something that is avoidably ugly?

But of course it is much easier to give in to the vices and to use pre made phrases that will think and speak for you.
