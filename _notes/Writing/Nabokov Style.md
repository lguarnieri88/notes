title: Nabokov’s comments on Style

Source: Lecture fragment from 1941. From the book “Think, Write, Speak”

Style is not determined by a certain choice of words, but by “intonation” and “the position of your main idea in the sentence”.

There is no personal style of writing without a personal view of the world. The connections and associations that one feels and sees will inevitably correspond to word associations on the page.

> The deeper your power of discovery, the keener you feel the novelty of the world around you, the more Eve you are and the less serpent, the firmer you refuse to have your world limited by the association of things in terms of usefulness or habit, -the more individual you prose will be. A ready made world unavoidably leads to the ready made word.
