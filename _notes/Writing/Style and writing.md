title: Style and Writing
---

Style is something that should arise from your sentences, and not something yo have to strive for. Strive for clarity and let style come out on its own.

> Style is an expression of the interest you take in the making of every sentence.

*[[Several Short Sentences on Writing]]*

Self-expression - Style is self-expression in the sense that is the fusion of your command of language and your commitment with your intent.

Clarity - Don’t pursue style, pursue clarity, and your clarity will differ with everyone else’s.
