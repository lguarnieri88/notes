# Vices While Writing
#Zettelkasten #publish

Vices that writers with bad habits use:
1. Dying metaphors. These are the metaphors in between the live metaphors, which assist the reader with a vivd image and the dead ones (e.g. _iron resolution_, which have reverted into common usage. Examples are: _stand shoulder to shoulder with, pay into the hands of, Achilles’ heel, Swan Song_. They are vague and 
2. Verbal False Limbs. The replacement of simple verbs by elaborate constructions, usually using nouns and passive voice. e.g. _In my opinion it is not an unjustifiable opinion_ in stead of _I think_.
3. Pretentious diction.
4. Meaningless words. Or words that have many different meanings which cannot be reconciled with each other. Orwell uses the example of words like _Fascism_ and _Democracy_ and their uses as meaning _bad_ and _good_. It points out that many times an author has a wish to deceive, and has a personal meaning (or a meaning that he favors) for a given word, but doesn’t take the time to point it out to the reader, allowing him to believe something different. 

Writing with these vices is easier. Phrases are already made, and many times in such a way that they already sound ok so you don’t have to bother with thinking about rhythm. The cost is leaving your meaning vague, not only for the reader but for yourself.

Mixed metaphors. The point of a metaphor is to bring up a vivid image. If the author is mixing metaphors (e.g. _The Fascist octopus has sang its swan song_) it is a sure sign that the author is not having a clear image of what he is saying. In other words, he is not thinking.
