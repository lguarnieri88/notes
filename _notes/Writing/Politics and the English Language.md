title: Politics and the English Language
---

Source: Essay from 1946 by George Orwell

Essay about language as a way to express thoughts, the relation between language and politics, the many vices that obscure the meaning of what one is trying to say and how to avoid them.

Despite focusing on politics, the points Orwell makes apply equally well to any field in which one wants to convey meaning through language.

**Diagnosis**
English is in bad shape. So is our civilization. This are not independent events but mutually reinforcing ones.

Bad habits in writing can be avoided if one has the will. This is the first step towards clear thinking, and this in turn is the first step towards “political regeneration”.

Two main characteristics appear in bad pieces of writing: Staleness of imagery and lack of precision.

> Prose consists less and less of _words_ chosen for the sake of their meaning and more and more of _phrases_ tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house.  

(This seems to make the reverse argument of Nabokov that a ready made world leads to the ready made word [[Nabokov’s comments on Style]]. Here the ready made phrases blur the world)

**Conclusion**
The defense of the (English) language has nothing to do with archaism or with correctness of grammar. It is all about making one’s meaning clear. It is about using the fewest, shortest words to convey what one wants.

> If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. Political language (…) is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one’s own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase (…) into the dustbin where it belongs.
