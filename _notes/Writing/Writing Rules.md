Title: Writing Rules
---

Some rules I try to follow when writing. These are more about the mechanics of writing rather than the higher level advice on process (don’t judge your first draft, etc.).

1. The fewer words, the better.
2. Don’t use ready-made phrases or images.
3. Don’t be pretentious, be clear.
4. Avoid the passive voice, double negatives, and anything that can obscure meaning.
