In [[Politics and the English Language]], Orwell gives his advice to all writers:

> What is needed above all is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around.  

Think concretely and then choose (not merely accept) the phrases that will convey that meaning.

When in doubt:
1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure usually seen in print.
2. Never use a long word when a short one will do.
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
5. Never use a foreign phrase a, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

Simple as they are, these rules imply a stark change of attitude towards writing. 

> If you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself. Political language (…) is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one’s own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase (…) into the dustbin where it belongs.
