title: Authority and Writing
---

Self-authorization - Writing is a constant act of self authorization. No one but you can authorize yourself. You do that by writing well and constant discovery. 

Unimportant - You’ve learned that what you discover by means of your own thinking is unimportant and unauthorized. You don’t believe your thoughts are interesting because yo haven’t learned to be interested in them. There’s another possibility, that you may be interested in what you think. (The same applies to what you notice)

Deference for authority - Change the deference and complacency of quoting material with the authority of your prose and your perspective. 

Origin - Authority comes from clarity of language and clarity of perception. Authority comes from the way you write.

The first person who should be convinced of your authority is you.
