Title: Oil Painting
---


There is an analogy between the way of seeing incorporated in oil painting and possessing something.
The new way of seeing the world (at the 15 hundreds), marked by a new attitude towards property an exchange, found its visual expression in the oil painting. 

There is a tension between a whole tradition and its masters that art history has done poorly discussing. Many times masters are taken as representative of a whole tradition when in fact they are exceptions. Nowhere is this tension more present than in the tradition of the oil painting.

Paintings in earlier traditions showed wealth, but as a part of a fixed or divine order. Oil Paintings showed it as a dynamic reality, marked by the flow of money. The paintings where designed to show the desirability of what money could buy. That desirability came with the tangibility of what was shown, with the way it would reward the senses.

This quality of oil paintings to depict such tangibility rendered it impractical for other types of paintings that werenâ€™t meant to show objects, e.g. religious and mythological paintings.

In the medieval tradition oftentimes gold was used inside the paintings. In the tradition of oil painting gold was pushed out to the frame. Instead of having gold, the tradition depicted what could be bought with it.

This dynamic of showing the desirability of what could be owned applied to many types of pictures (objects, animals, portraits). It applied least to landscape.

The oil painting is an art form based on the premise that you are what you possess. It is a celebration of private property.

> The special qualities of oil painting lent themselves to a special system of conventions for representing the visible. The sum total of these conventions is the way of seeing invented by oil painting.
