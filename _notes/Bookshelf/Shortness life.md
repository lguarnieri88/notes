title: On the shortness of life, on the happy life, on leisure - By Seneca
---


This three treatises discuss many of the topics dear to Seneca, such as freedom, how to use one’s time, the differences between pleasure and virtue, and how to act in many situations. At times repetitive, but well argued and with powerful images throughout.

**Some common threads:**
* Fortune is fickle and a terrible foundation for happiness. Those who base their happiness on what Fortune brings don’t know true joy, because they know that Fortune can take away those very things in the same way that it has given them.
* It’s not about what the majority wants or judges more kindly, it’s about what is really best.
* Ownership of oneself and unity of mind. One must strive not to be owned by riches or pleasure or fame, but to live according to one’s Nature, enjoying whatever might come one’s way.

**On the shortness of life/ On leisure**
* Life itself is not short, but we shorten it making ourselves busy with matters that aren’t all that important.
* It is a mistake to live as if one would live forever. One postpones many things for old age when it’s not really a guarantee that one will even get there.
* Busyness is a trap. A busy man cannot do anything the way it should. Only the life of busy people is short.
* Who are these busy people? Not only those that busy themselves with work, but also those who waste their lives in banquets and such leisurely endeavors (those that have a “busy leisure”).
* Only those with time for wisdom know true leisure. 
* It is brief and hard the life of those who forget the past, squander the present and fear the future.

**On the happy life**
* Happiness comes with freedom, and freedom means not being dependent on Fortune. Happy is the person who, thanks to reason, doesn’t fear or desire.

* To be happy is to live according to nature and to not be owned by anything:

> To live happily, then, is the same thing as to live according to Nature: what this may be, I will explain. If we guard the endowments of the body and the advantages of nature with care and fearlessness, as things soon to depart and given to us only for a day; if we do not fall under their dominion, nor allow ourselves to become the slaves of what is no part of our own being; if we assign to all bodily pleasures and external delights the same position which is held by auxiliaries and light-armed troops in a camp; if we make them our servants, not our masters—then and then only are they of value to our minds.  


> A man should be unbiased and not to be conquered by external things: he ought to admire himself alone, to feel confidence in his own spirit, and so to order his life as to be ready alike for good or for bad fortune. Let not his confidence be without knowledge, nor his knowledge without steadfastness: let him always abide by what he has once determined, and let there be no erasure in his doctrines. It will be understood, even though I append it not, that such a man will be tranquil and composed in his demeanour, high-minded and courteous in his actions (…)  
> Such a mind, when it has ranged itself in order, made its various parts agree together, and, if I may so express myself, harmonized them, has attained to the highest good: for it has nothing evil or hazardous remaining, nothing to shake it or make it stumble: it will do everything under the guidance of its own will, and nothing unexpected will befall it, but whatever may be done by it will turn out well, and that, too, readily and easily, without the doer having recourse to any underhand devices: for slow and hesitating action are the signs of discord and want of settled purpose. You may, then, boldly declare that the highest good is singleness of mind: for where agreement and unity are, there must the virtues be: it is the vices that are at war one with another.  

* One should not be guided by pleasure or riches. If they come, so be it, but one should not look for them and make them one’s guide. 
* If one pursues pleasure one ends up being owned by it, instead of owning whichever pleasure may come in the pursuit of virtue. The same with riches.
