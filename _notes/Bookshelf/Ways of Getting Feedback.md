Not all feedback comes from asking direct questions (solicited) or by hearing what people volunteer. You can get a lot of valuable information by paying attention to what others do and from the way they act around you. Here are five ways of doing that. 

1. Make a list of people’s casual remarks about you - “you’re late”, “are you paying attention?”, “yes, you said that”, etc. Then look at the list and see what patterns emerge.
2. Turn the sound off - if you are in a group, try to forget about the words and look at other’s body language towards you, whether they lean towards you or away, whether they pay attention or take their phones out. A variation: get early to a meeting and see how the people that come to the meeting respond to your presence.
3. Complete the sentence - pick a thing you want to change (e.g. I want to get in shape), then complete the sentence “If I do that, one benefit will be that…) in as many ways as you can. The idea is that you start with the obvious and then get more personal. This is a way of giving feedback to yourself by uncovering personal motives.
4. Pay attention to self-aggrandizing of deprecating remarks - Many times, the things you brag about are the very things you really need to work on. Similarly, self-deprecating remarks are tricks to cover our tracks. So if you make remarks such as “I’m not very good at ...”, you probably don’t believe it and should look into it.
5. Look homeward - Our flaws don’t disappear when we go home. So if you want to know how your behavior comes across with your colleagues, ask the same questions you would ask them to your family and loved ones. They are the ones that really want you to succeed and will tell the truth.
