Title: The 80/20 Principle
---

Book about the Pareto principle, which is all about imbalances. One possible formulation: the minority of causes give way to the majority of consequences. The general conclusion: focus on that minority and not much else.

There are two main areas to apply the principle: to find efficiencies and for life enhancement. Some of the uses of the principle are:

* In Business: 20% of clients and 20% of products account for 80%+ of revenue. One should focus absurdly on those customers and products and largely disregard the rest.
* Processes: 80% of failures come from 20% of the causes. Generally speaking, if one sorts out some of those causes things improve disproportionately.
* Time: it’s no use trying to increase productivity, one has to identify the time investments that give the highest returns and focus on those.
* Life in general: 80% of happiness comes from a minority of people and activities. One should, oh surprise, focus on those.

The case of returns on investments is also interesting (majority of returns coming from minority of investments), as is contrary to the common knowledge of diversification.

Seven happiness habits (to do daily): Excersice / Mental Stimulation / Spiritual Stimulation (art, meditation, etc.) / Doing a good turn / Taking a pleasure break with a friend / Give yourself a treat / Congratulate yourself.

As a book it is a bit repetitive, the main idea is clear, solid and time tested so it’s a great read, but, oh sweet irony, 80% of the value comes from 20% of the pages.
