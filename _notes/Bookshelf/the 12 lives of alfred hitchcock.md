title: The 12 Lives of Alfred Hitchcock
---

Unconventional biography of AH, featuring 12 aspects of his life.

* Childhood
	* There’s an origin myth about a time when AH’s father sent him to the police station with a note and he had to spend the night there.
	* AH treated both children and adults in the same way in the set and elsewhere.
	* He was very successful among kids, and received a great number of letters and stuff from them.
	* He never spoke much of either the war or his father’s death, but must have been impacted greatly by them.

* Murder
	* He liked De Quincy’s idea of murder as a fine art.
	* The murder in Psycho serves as an opening to the sixties.
	* He was influenced by Jack the Ripper and the penny dreadfuls that circulated during his childhood.
	* One of his biggest motivations was shaking up the viewer’s life, and he used murder as a means of putting into question sex, class and other issues.

* The Fat Man
	* Food was a creative outlet for his creativity and theatricality. He and Alma loved to entertain and she was a great cook.
	* Food in his movies was always treacherous. There were many poisonings and other means of death by food (leg of lamb).
	* He was very sensitive about criticism in general and about his shape in particular, yet joked about it in several occasions.
	* His lack of control over his body and shape contrasted greatly with the control he exerted over others.

* The Dandy
	* There are two different versions of dandyism coming from the nineteenth century, and Hitchcock has traits from both of them. The unifying characteristics are the belief that a polished outward appearance shows a sort of inward spiritual mastery, and that taste and style are vital for an elevated life n the city. They also share the belief that life can be bettered through devotion to the small details.
	* One of the versions is represented best by Oscar Wilde, and has the dandy as a flamboyant person always preoccupied with its outer appearance. Whereas the other is more austere and low key.
	* Hitch was very preoccupied with clothing, both for himself and for his films. His outward appearance reflected the way he conducted himself, with precision, rigor and efficacy.
	* Ritual, performed with style was a key element of his way of working. He insisted on keeping reasonable work hours, a way of showing he run things and not the other way around.
	* Many of his characters are dandies, and end up seeing their surface broken at some point, begging the question of whether all the effort is really worth it.
	* In /Rope/ two dandy types perform a murder in a very sophisticated setting, showing the proximity of civility and brutality.

* The Voyeur
	* Looking, watching and seeing were big themes for Hitch.  He is well aware of the place of looking in the art cannon. The peephole through which Bates looks Marion in Psycho is beneath a print of a renaissance painting of two mean looking at a woman bathing.
	* Rear Window puts watching center stage, and is his most cinematic film, in the sense that it puts in play all the qualities that set cinema apart from other visual arts. And it’s also one of the more contemporary, as you can easily replace Jeff’s window for an iPhone and social media. “We’ve become a race of peeping Toms” Stella says.
	* He was not only interested in watching and looking, he was very good at reading people, often deciding on a collaboration over a short lunch.
	* Despite claiming to not be interested in other directors work, he was very much up to date with the cinema of his time.
	* Where he made a difference was not in story, that was what writers were there for. He made a difference with his eye.
	* Whenever he spoke of his work he spoke in metaphors. He mentioned Cezanne and his favorite visual artist, Paul Klee.
	* House by the railroad, by Ed Hopper seems to have inspired the Bates House.
	* About the stories: He avoided fantasy because people should be able to identify with the characters. “Fairytales against a realistic environment”
	
* The Entertainer
	* He devised a set of rituals from early on. To mark the end of a filming break, he’d smash a cup of coffee against the floor.
	* Comedy was very important to him. He always looked for stories with plenty of action and introduced the comedy himself. 
	* He measured whether he could connect with someone via his jokes. He played with taboo and shock.
	* He played with the ambiguity of whether situations were meant to produce gasps or laughs.
	* In many of his films his characters were in situations that made them lose their dignity and knock them off their perch.
	* The disapproval of people who thought much of themselves and the need to make jokes about them may come from a tradition of English humor. The need to prank or otherwise make practical jokes may have something to do with his aversion to conflict and lack of ways to deal with stressful situations.

* The pioneer
	* One of his biggest talents was the ability to reinvent himself while staying the same.
	* As he advanced in his career he found that content was second to form. The most important thing was to produce a certain effect on his audience, much more than transmitting content.
	* He was innovative in being center stage of the promotion of his films. 
	* He prided himself on knowing more about any department than anyone except the head of that department.
	* Despite his fame as an obsessive planner, his sets where very much an experimentation ground, where he tried out many things and learned along the way.
	* He was very interested in every new tech development that could help him generate his desired effects on the audience. Sound and color were welcomed to further his cause, 3D was met with disapproval. He innovated greatly with his sets.
	* **Style** is the act of plagiarizing oneself.
	
* The Londoner
The most interesting thing about this chapter was the way travels played into Hitchcock’s life and work. 
	* As he began, a trip to Germany put him into contact with other forms of cinema that transformed his craft. 
	* He was hailed as a true British director and his art was celebrated among all the talk about Hollywood being the enemy and a sort of virus that infected young people’s minds.
	* He left for Hollywood as Britain was entering the WWII, and it was seen as a sor of treason. 
	* In Hollywood we felt like a citizen of the world and some of that cosmopolitanism shows trough in his work of that period.
