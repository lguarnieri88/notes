title: La literatura Nazi en América
---

A collection of short biographies of fictional writers that lived in America and were associated or sympathized with nazi thought. It’s an amazing feat of creativity that is funny, truculent and very imaginative.  It remembers other collections of fictional biographies (/Historia Universal de la Infamia/ comes to mind) and makes you think, as Bolaño usually does, of the link between stories, literature and reality.


* It’s amazing to see how Bolaño invented a world in which the Nazi stories and belief system transforms at this side of the Atlantic and throughout the continent. The book made me think of the way ideas spread and transform according of time and place. 
* The means of spreading the poems and stories take central stage. The literary magazines, publishers, and so on. A sort of circulatory system for ideas.
* It’s quite crazy how many times you find yourself liking the characters, however terrible their acts were.
