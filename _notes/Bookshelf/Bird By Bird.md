Title: Bird by bird

Book about how to sit down, quiet the voices in your head and get pen to paper. It’s surprising how much of writing comes down to mental states and the voices in your head, being able to identify, label and let go of them.

At parts it feels a bit too personal, and tells more about the author than about writing in general. The advice is more on the process of writing than on the details of how to do it, but still solid. 

**Some Themes**
* Publication means little. It’s not going to do anything that you think it will. Focus on the process of writing rather than publishing.
* Little Frames: Writing is hard, and you’re not going to get anything done unless you get started. For that, focus on little assignments, start by a paragraph, describing what you can see through a one inch picture frame.
* Shitty First Drafts: Again, writing is hard. Start somewhere, make it little, make it bad. No-one is going to read it, you’ll edit it later.
* Perfectionism: it is a misconception to think that if you make it perfect you’re never going to die and be happy forever. Other people will get more done and have more fun too. Get to the page, quiet the voices and write.
* Giving: contrary to intuition, if you give everything  to your work, there will always be more.


**Quotes**
* Good writing is about telling the truth
* Awareness is learning to keep yourself company
* “A critic is someone who comes to the battlefield after the battle is over and shoots the wounded”
* You don’t always have to chop with the sword of truth, you can point with it too.
* Life is lukewarm enough! Give us some heat!
* Be afraid of not getting your writing done.
* I don’t think you have that kind of time. I don’t think you have time to waste not writing because you are afraid you won’t be good enough at it.
* The business of becoming conscious, of being a writer, is ultimately about asking yourself (…) how alive am I willing to be.
