These are the books I’ve been reading, my comments and [[Book ratings|rating]]. Some of them have specific notes, which range between random thoughts and incomplete summaries.



**Todos los fuegos el fuego** - 4 - 20/12/2022

<img style="float: left;" src="/assets/todos_los_fuegos.jpeg" width="100"/>
Another classic collection of short stories. I may not be Cortázar's greatest fan, but some of the texts here are amazing. Particularly the first two (Autopista del Sur and La salud de los enfermos) blew my mind, but in general they are one of the best short story collections by Cortázar.

**El llano en llamas** - 3 - 11/12/2022

A collection of short stories by Juan Rulfo, an absolute classic of Mexican literature. I did not enjoy it so much as Pedro Páramo, but still found the stories engaging. Violence and nonsense stood out as topics throughout the different stories. It strikes me how much of the ethos in the stories I can find very much present in day to day Mexican life.

**[[Ways of seeing]]** - 4 - 6/12/2022

Book from a series of tv shows the BBC launched in 1972. Each chapter is a sort of essay on a particular topic: how did the reproducibility of art change the way we experience it, the tradition of oil painting, the nude and the publicity image. They all revolve around the idea that seeing is a much less spontaneous act than we tend to believe. 

** The Liar’s Dictionary** - 3 - 5/12/2022

Novel about a present day woman that works at an encyclopedic dictionary and one of the XIXth century editors of the dictionary. As a person that spends quite some time thinking about words and language I liked it, but I would have enjoyed a more direct link between both stories. It brings up the questions of what is a personal dictionary, and why do we crystallize meaning in words. 

**[[The Dip]]** - 4 - 13/11/2022

Book about quitting. Contrary to common belief (don’t quit!), the book tries to show how to consider quitting as a strategic move. Learn to know where you stand and make a decision, the options are to carry on with the difficulties and end up stronger on the other side or quit to focus your energy elsewhere. Pick your battles. Many of the arguments resonate with both [[The 80-20 Principle]] and [[The Star Principle]].

**[[The War of Art]]** - 4 - 4/11/2022

Book about the creative pursuit, what stands between a person and being creative and different ways to fight it. Read if you’re interested in any way of creative outlet. It has many common points with [[The practice]], and also with [[The Inner Game of Tennis]] (it’s subtitle is “Winning the inner creative battle”)

**[[The 12 Lives of Alfred Hitchcock]]** - 4 - 31/10/2022

Biography of AH that focusses on 12 different aspects of his life and career. It does not address his films one by one but comes and goes as he makes his points. Very good account of a multifaceted creator that shows his talents and shortcomings. It leaves you wanting to rewatch many of his films. Loved the chapters on dandyism, London (and the role his travels to Germany and Hollywood played in his way of working) and the one on his role as a pioneer that tried out whatever new technological mean was available to produce his intended effect on the audience.

**[[La Literatura Nazi en América]]** - 3

A collection of short biographies of fictional writers that lived in America and were associated or sympathized with nazi thought. It’s an amazing feat of creativity that is funny, truculent and very imaginative.  It remembers other collections of fictional biographies (/Historia Universal de la Infamia/ comes to mind) and makes you think, as Bolaño usually does, of the link between stories, literature and reality.

**[[Several Short Sentences about Writing]]** - 4


**Novela de Ajedrez** - 3

Short and sweet. Story about a man and his obsession with chess, how he comes by it and how it comes back after many years of not playing. It’s a nice weekend read if you are at all into chess.

**Song of Achilles** - 3

The perfect read for a week at the beach. I love mythology and the stories of Ancient Greece so this one hit the spot. It tells the story of Achilles from his early years and up to the Troyan War, but from the perspective of Patroclus, his inseparable companion. I did not enjoy this one as much as Circe, but still a good book if you like the genre.

**[[The Practice]]** - 4

**[[Old Masters]]** - 3

How much better is to read TB than to read about him. This “comedy” tells the story of two men that meet at a museum in Viena. As with other of his novels this is mostly an excuse to go on for pages on end about other things: seeing, watching, contemplating, the unity of the creative endeavor. Not the best I read from him but it went well with my interest this year on the visual arts in general.


**La vida privada de los árboles** - 4

Very short but well crafted novel.  A man takes care of his stepdaughter while waiting for his wife to come back home from drawing class. The stories he tells his daughter before going to sleep, himself to explain the fact that his wife hasn’t yet come home and the book he is writing all overlap to show the power of telling stories.

**A Gentleman in Moscow** - 3

Novel about a man that is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol hotel in Moscow, 1918. A novel about fate and what you do with it and how small gestures make big differences. A bit on the long side, but with great moments and a great main character.

**Retótica especulativa** - 3

Outline of a western, anti-philosophical tradition that started in Rome with Fronto (Marcus Aurelius’ tutor), and continued with several figures throughout history. Philosophy is a poor discipline, because it argues, but it doesn’t show things. Language has the incredible ability to deal with mental images. To cultivate that ability is the ultimate pursuit.

**Conversaciones con Thomas Bernhard** - 2

Book of interviews with the Austrian writer. It has some interesting topics (prose as music, postwar literature in Germany, etc.) but nothing great. I would only recommend it for die hard fans of TB, but frankly I don’t see any instance I would rather read this book than one of his novels.

**Magritte: A Life** - 4

Biography of the surrealist painter. I greatly enjoyed the discussions on his paintings, motives and influences, but it is a bit long and would only recommend it for those interested in Magritte. 

**The Baron in the trees** - 3
 
Not my favorite Calvino by a long stretch. A novel about a young man that decides one day to climb up a tree and live without going back to the ground for the rest of his life.
I enjoyed the idea of the unapologetic young man that keeps true to himself till the end, but little else. Some of the episodes throughout were ok, but I don’t think I’ll be going back.

**[[Storytelling with data]]**- 4

Great book about how to communicate better with data. From the basics of which charts to use for what and the importance of communicating through  a story, it’s a great place to start in Data Visualization. Very pragmatic and with examples that one can apply immediately to real time situations. It doesn’t go too deep on the different topics though, and references other books and resources to further look into. 

**The Witness (El entenado) - JJ Saer - 3**  - [[El entenado]]

A man in his eighties, living in XVth century Spain writes about his experience living ten years among the Indians in America. Half adventure book, half philosophical treaty, written in beautiful prose and dealing with perception, memory and reality. Made me think of Gulliver’s Travels throughout. I loved it but it does get a bit heavy at points.


**[[The 12 Week Year]]**

By Brian P. Moran

Book about shortening your execution cycle from 12 months to 12 weeks. The main idea is to shorten the cycle so you get the improved performance that comes with deadlines and not losing sight of your goals. Besides the main idea, it presents a whole system to improve productivity.

[[The Star Principle]]

By Richard Koch - 3

Similar to [[The 80-20 Principle]], the book presents a principle and discusses its many applications. Like the 80/20 principle, the main idea is good but it had a lot of padding around it. Worth knowing what it’s about but perhaps you don’t need to read the whole book.

**La Casa del Padre**

/By Justo Navarro/ - 3

Perhaps Navarro’s best known novel. I’ve been meaning to read it for quite some time and it didn’t disappoint. I’m partial to many of his themes (doubles, symmetries, etc.) but most of all I love his prose style, rhythmic and fluid at the same time. I would recommend it for anyone interested in good Spanish prose.

*Before 2022*

[[The 80-20 Principle]]

By Richard Koch

01/03/2021 - 3

Book about the Pareto principle, which is all about imbalances. One possible formulation: the minority of causes give way to the majority of consequences. The general conclusion: focus on that minority and not much else.

[[Bird By Bird]]

By Anne Lamott

30/8/2021 - 3

Book about how to sit down, quiet the voices in your head and get pen to paper.  At parts it feels a bit too personal, and tells more about the author than about writing in general. The advice is more on the process of writing than on the details of how to do it, but still solid.
