Title: Ways of Seeing
---

Book from a series of tv shows the BBC launched in 1972 (so this year is its 50th anniversary)

It’s divided into four discussions with “visual essays” in between. The whole premise of the book is that seeing is a much less spontaneous and natural thing than we tend to believe (e.g. [[Framing]]), and that there’s a whole set of conventions that support our ways of seeing. The book goes into four discussions about 

[[Ways of looking at art]]: How the technical reproduction of works of art changed the way we see them.
[[The Nude]] as a way of seeing that emerges from a particular tradition.
[[Oil Painting]], it’s qualities and how it turned out to be ideal to express the new attitudes of the 15th century towards property and exchange.
[[The Publicity Image]]: a sort of continuation of the tradition of the oil painting with changes brought by the mass market.

I think it begs the question of what more and newer ways of seeing the traditions of the digital world have brought about.
