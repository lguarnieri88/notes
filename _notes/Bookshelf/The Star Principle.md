---

Book that presents the Star Principle and discusses its importance in deciding where to work or invest. It has a good last chapter summarizing everything so perhaps start there and see if it’s interesting to you.


**General Ideas**
* Star principle: If you classify companies according to its size (sales) and % growth, you can single out the stars as those which a)  are leaders in their space and b) have high growth rates (>10% for the next 5 years or more)
* It’s not about you. It’s not about how talented you or your team are, how much you work or similar considerations. The main cause of success is being at the right place and having circumstances work for you.
* Irrational expectations are important. The world is far from uniform, and the smallest amount of players (people, companies) accrue the largest portion of the value (Cf. [[The 80\/20 Principle]])  The trick is to place oneself in that minority and invest one’s time, energy and /or money there.
