Book about the creative journey, art and shipping your work.

Being creative is something that you do, and therefore a choice. Focus on the practice, just show up.

Consistency v authenticity- you don’t want an authentic surgeon. You want consistency.

Credentials are a bluff, but they wouldn’t be so effective if we ourselves wouldn’t rule su out for not having them.

Trust yourself, trust the practice of showing up to do the work consistently, trust that your perspective is valuable and if you notice something or have a particular take on something there’s a reason for it.

Minimum viable breakthrough.
