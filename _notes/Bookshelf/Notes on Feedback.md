Title: Notes on Feedback

Source: [[What Got You Here]]

Two problems with feedback - The recipient doesn’t want to hear it, and the rest of the world doesn’t want to give it.

Negative feedback - 

Feedback and opinion - Don’t express opinion after asking for feedback. If someone is giving you their honest opinion your reaction should be to thank them, and nothing else.

Solicited feedback - There is **only one** way to ask for feedback. It’s any variation on the question “how can I do better?” 
It has to have four key elements:
* Solicit advice rather than criticism
* Be directed towards the future rather than obsessed with negative past
* Be phrased in a way that suggests you will act on it.
