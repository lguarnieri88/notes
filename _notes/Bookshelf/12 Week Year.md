Title: 12 Week Year
---

Book about shortening your execution cycle from 12 months to 12 weeks. The main idea is to shorten the cycle so you get the improved performance that comes with deadlines and not losing sight of your goals. Besides the main idea, it presents a whole system to improve productivity. It presents 3 principles and 5 disciplines that you should master in order to boost your production. These are:

Principles:
* Accountability: this is ownership of whatever happens. It means that you won’t look for excuses or won’t blame others for what happens.
* Commitment: It’s accountability taken into the future.
* Greatness in the moment: Results are just a recognition that you have been doing well. They are a lagging indicator of greatness in execution and in the moment. You should be taking the appropriate actions every step of the way, and in that respect, you’ll be great every moment. “If you take care of the minutes, the years will take care of themselves”.

Disciplines
* Vision: You’ll need a compelling vision of the future for when things get tough.
* Planning: A vision without a plan is a pipe dream.
* Process Control: A set of tools and events that align your daily actions with the critical points of your plan.
* Measure: Your anchor with reality.
* Time Use: Avery action takes place in time, so managing your time properly is critical.

Putting it together
* You need first of all a clear vision. Write it out, you can review it at the beginning of each cycle.
* For each cycle, you set your goals. Better few than many. Ideally no more than three, never more than five.
* Do a weekly planning where you put what you’re going to be doing each week of the cycle towards your goals.
* At the beginning of each week you do a review of the tasks you did v your plan. Score your week.
* Iterate trying to tune whatever is not working.
* At the end of the cycle you get one week to relax and plan your next one.

Some of the ideas I found more interesting:
* Time Use: the idea of having different blocks of time so that you organize yourself better.
	* Strategic blocks: once a week, three hours. To work on what really matters to get to your goals.
	* Buffer Blocks: blocks to answer mail or do other similar low value tasks.
	* Break blocks: once a month, three hours, to relax.
* Measurement: Don’t use measurement as a proxy for accountability, use it as feedback. If you derive consequences from the measures that will make people run away from measuring and will ultimately be unproductive.
* The whole argument in favor of shortening the execution cycle is quite compelling.
