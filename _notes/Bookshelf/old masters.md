title: Old Masters

Two men agree to meet at one specific room inside the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Viena. Reger, whom the narrator is about to meet is a music specialist that writes for a newspaper and has turned a widower a few months back. Most of the book is comprised of the reflections of Reger, as related by Atzbacher (the narrator).

Many themes repeat from other books, so it’s a good book if you already know you like TB. 


On discipline:
This is not a quote but an observation. For Reger his discipline of going to the museum every day in the morning and to the hotel in the afternoon, and to have a strict discipline of being in those (in time strictly controlled) places is a matter of survival.

Unity of arts:

> The fine arts complement music in a wonderful way and the one is always beneficial to the other, he said. I could not imagine my musicological studies without a discussion with the so called fine arts.

The critical art

Reger recognizes himself as a critical artist, that takes part in all the arts through his very own form of art, that is, the works he publishes in The Times:

> I certainly regard myself as an artist, that is as a critical artist, and as a critical artist I am of course also creative, that is obvious, hence a /performing and creative critical artist/, he said. What is more, a creative and performing critical artist of the Times, he said. I certainly regard my brief reports for the Times as works of art, and I think that as the author of these works of art I am always in one person and simultaneously a painter and a musician and a writer. That is my greatest delight: to know that as the author of these works of art for The Times I am a painter and a musician and a writer in one, that is my greatest delight. I am not, therefore, as the painters are, only a painter, and I am not, as the musicians are, only a musician, and I am not, as the writers are, only a writer, you must understand that /I am a painter and a musician and a writer all in one/ (…)  It is possible, he said, that the critical artist is the one who practises his own art in all the arts and is aware of it, utterly and totally aware of it.

On contemplating “Totally”:

> Now I know that I must not read totally or listen totally or view and contemplate totally if I want to go on living. There is an art in not reading totally and not listening totally and not viewing totally or looking totally, he said. I have not quite mastered tat art yer, he said, because my natural inclination is to approach everything totally and to persevere totally and bring it to a conclusion totally, that is, you should know, my real misfortune, he said. 

And then he suggests a way to do this:

> one method, he said, is to turn everything into a caricature. We can only stand a great, important picture if we have turned ir into a caricature, or a great man, a so-called important personality, neither can we bear a person as a great man or as an important personality, he said, we haver to caricature him.

On Admiration:

> We cannot endure a state of admiration for long, and we perish if we do not break it off in time. (…) Real intellect does not knot admiration: it acknowledges, it respects, it esteems, tat is all, he said. 

And he goes on to note that people go into museum with a great deal of admiration, instead of walking normally. That would be a much better way to appreciate the works.

> Admiration is easier than respect, admiration is the characteristic of the dimwit.

On the availability of music:

Reger notes that the expectations on music have changed as a result of its avalability:

> The idols, the top artists, the most ideal and the most competent performers have grown old and incompetent, Reger said. The present generation, curiously enough, no longer makes the highest demands on music, those which were made on music a mere fifteen or twenty years ago. The reason is that listening to music has become a /trivial everyday affair as a result of technical progress./
