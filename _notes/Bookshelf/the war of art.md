title: The War of Art
---

The book is divided in three. The first part focuses on the enemy of creativity, the second on how to deal with it and the third (more esoteric) on a higher realm of creativity.

The enemy: a big part of the book is showing the reader that there is such thing as an enemy (he calls it resistance), it is concrete, specific and that ir will bury you along with any grand intentions you have if you leave it unattended.

I don’t think there is a single definition of Resistance in the book, but there is a thorough description of what elicits resistance, what are the symptoms and how to recognize and deal with them.

Resistance is what keeps you from doing your work, through whatever means possible. You never get passed having to deal with it, no matter how long you have been doing what you do. It has allies (rationalization, victimhood, procrastination, addiction, etc.), and it is fueled by fear. 

How to beat Resistance? By turning pro. Here lies the second most important point of the book. It argues that you should treat creativity the way you would any regular job. You don’t skip days at the office, and neither should you when it comes to your creative practice. You might get distracted, talk to someone during the day, etc. but the fact is that when it comes to work, you show up and handle things the best you can. 

The pro knows better than to deny the existence of Resistance, he respects it as a force to be reckoned with.

The biggest fear any of us has is the fear to succeed, and to turn in the end into what deep inside we know we can turn into.

About parte three, the idea of art as a territorial pursuit is the one I found most interesting. You have two ways of being in the world. Territorially or Hierarchically. In a hierarchy, you define yourself based on the other members of the hierarchy. In the territory, you define yourself based on your relationship with it. A territory may be a geography or a practice, it is where you go to recharge your energy. A territory provides sustenance, but only gives back what you put into it.
