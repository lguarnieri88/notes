title: The Dip
---

This is a book about quitting. In the same style as [[The practice]], there are several short texts around a central idea, which make the book very easy to read.

The main argument goes:
* The world is an unbalanced place. The rewards for being number one are orders of magnitude larger than being number two. (cf. [[The 80\/20 Principle]])
* For almost everything you do you are in one of these two curves (and a few other curves cover the rest.
	* The Dip: the place were things get difficult, a bit after the start, once you have learnt/done the basics. This is where most people quit.
	* The Cul de Sac: the dead end. Where you enter into a pattern of effort that doesn’t make you grow, but only stay more or less the same. This is where people stick it out.
* The point is that if you want to be number one (and you should be convinced you do by the first point), you are going to face the dip. And if you quit at that point you’ll never get to the point when you get the rewards of having gone through the difficult part. **Value comes from scarcity. Scarcity comes from surviving the dip**
* Conversely, if you don’t quit when you’re in a Cul de Sac, you’ll pay an enormous cost of opportunity in time and energy that would be better spent facing the dip.
* So, quit every Cul de Sac, and double down on every dip. **The opposite of quitting is not just hanging around**. If you decide that something is worth your effort you should focus on it and get to the other side.
* **Pick your Battles** A good idea is to decide before you start a quest whether you have the energy or resources to go to the end of it. If not, don’t even start. You are going for number one or not playing at all. In this sense, the book resonates with [[The Star Principle]], find a niche in which you can be no1 and stick with it.
