title: Leonardo Da Vinci - By W. Isaacson
---

Biography of the most iconic renaissance man. Leonardo himself is perhaps the most interesting person to write a biography, and the book does a great job of describing him in all his greatness, while pointing out that he was an ordinary man with an extraordinary curiosity. The book uses his notebooks as a central point of the narrative and goes from there to the paintings, travels, patrons and all the other aspects.


Highlights:
Leonardo was born out of wedlock, which meant he could no go fulfill the family tradition of becoming a notary. He would continue all his life to be a bit of an eccentric, vegetarian, left handed, etc.

Conception > execution - He conceptualized and imagined many things that never came into being or that he did not finish producing (like many works of art or his treatise on birds). And the works he did finish, were worked on and modified for years on end.

Movement. He tried to paint in a way that the movements of the characters showed their internal states of being. He was a firm believer in Alberti’s injunction that one should paint people from the inside out, understanding their motives and moods before starting to work.

Notebooks. He used his notebooks to record many of his interests. He wrote about everything, other than intimate stuff. Paper was expensive so he used every last bit of it. It is thought that he intended to order some of the material into longer pieces, but as with many of his works of art, he would not see that through.

Analogy. He used analogy repeatedly as a method of thinking (for example when comparing the flow of people in a city to the circulatory system of the human body or when studying the flow of wate to understand the air)

Not publishing. There are findings in Leonardo’s notebooks that would not be rediscovered but centuries later. He didn’t have or believe in the notion of publishing thoughts and ideas to share them and advance general Knowledge.

Sfumato.  He did not believe in drawing exact and precise contours, but in blurring the lines between objects, pioneering the technique of sfumato. He wrote so in a series of notes letter edited as a treatise on painting. 

Sfumato bis - Not only did he use it as a stylistic element, it was also an attitude. The blurring of limits between domains of knowledge. The ambiguity of a smile. Nothing would seem to be clearly contained in a delineated frame. 

Math. He favored Geometry over Arithmetic, and was quite bad at the latter. He mentioned the difference between continuous quantities and discrete ones, and favored Geometry because it dealt with continuous ones.  He was friend of Luca Pacioli and drew many figures for his treatise On Divine Proportion. This drawings were the only ones he published during his lifetime.

The mechanical arts. He had the conception that everything was a machine. The human body, the world, animals. Motion was one of the notions that interested him the most.

Motivation. Most often, Leonardo would start studying something (anatomy, optics, geometry, etc.) to apply that knowledge to his paintings, but would end up continuing to study them to understand nature more deeply.

Disecting a horse. Before he started working on the monument to the honor of Ludovico Sforza’s father (which would represent him with full armor and on a horse), he started directing horses (and continued to investigate equine anatomy).

Disecting a face - Perhaps it is not necessary to direct a face in order to paint a smile, but, then again, the most famous smile in painting came from the hand of one who did both. 

Method of working.- Leonardo liked to procrastinate. He slow to start and complete a commission, and many of his painting he worked throughout many years, adding layers of details as he went. 

Drawing drapes - He practiced his drawing skills in the study of Verrocchio by drawing drapes. In that way he learned to depict shadows, which were central to his art, and got acquainted with chiaroscuro and sfumato.

Observation - Leonardo was a great observer of nature. He contributed most of all to acuity perspective, which is the study of how things are seen differently depending on how far from the beholder they are. 

Reach and grasp - Leonardo’s reach far exceeded his grasp, as many of the things he thought and conceptualized wouldn’t come to be until many years or centuries later.

Observation and experimentation - Observation was the basis of it all. From dissecting horses and human faces to paint them better to observing the way perception changes with distance, Leonardo put observation at the center. Experimentation came when he observed things he couldn’t explain and he was ready to dismiss any idea he had if the experiment and observation told him he was wrong.

Squaring the circle - He was interested in the problem of squaring the circle and circular sections. He had a geometric construction on the last page of his notebook.

The last phrase of his notebooks - The soup is getting cold.
