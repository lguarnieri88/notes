title: The Minimalist Entrepreneur
---

Book about a different way of starting and leading a company.  Different from what? From the unicorn obsessed start ups that pop out everywhere. Applied common sense.

Some points worth pointing out:

* You start, then learn.
* The correct order is community, problem, product, customers, company.
* Do things in the right order (above), don’t get yourself in debt, care for your customers, wait to hire until it’s absolutely necessary.
