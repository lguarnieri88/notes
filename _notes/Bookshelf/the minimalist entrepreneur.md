title: The Minimalist Entrepreneur
---

Book about a different way of starting and leading a company.  Different from what? From the unicorn obsessed start ups that pop out everywhere. Applied common sense.

Non commutative - You don’t learn, then start. You start, then learn.

Things to do every day - 
	* Work in public 
	* Teach everything you know
	* Create every day

Correct order - The correct order is community, problem, product, customers, company.

Interests, not skills - Building a business is about interests, not skills. Don’t worry about the things you don’t know, focus on the things that you do know and learn from there.

Pointers on social media - 
* People don’t care about your business and its success, it cares about you and your struggles.
* Be authentic. It’s all about ideas, not people. Be yourself but focus on acting out a set of values. Tell about what you learnt, the conversations you had, the challenges you faced. 
* Build your business in public and share it with your customers.

Spending money - 
> Keep an eye on the numbers and your ears on the customers.

Stay focused - It’s easy to get sloppy when your business is growing and you’re overwhelmed, but that’s the moment when you should be more disciplined about how you spend your money and time.

No free lunch - You will feel the pressure to spend more money as you have more, but be watchful. Don’t hire until absolutely necessary, don’t move to a fancy office, etc.
