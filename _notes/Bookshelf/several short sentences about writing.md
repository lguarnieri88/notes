The main Thesis of the book is that you should focus on short sentences. Some Important points:

* Long sentences often hide messy thinking.
* Meaning is only one aspect of the sentence. Get acquainted with all the others, such as rhythm and form.
* Writing is a never ending exercise in self-authorization, everything other than that is an excuse or a place to hide. Cf. [[The practice]]

* Eliminate transitions and useless repetitions. Don’t underestimate the reader.
* Eliminate all the words that are not essential. You can go one by one and see what the sentences looses or gains by letting go of a word.
