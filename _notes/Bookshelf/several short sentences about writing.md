title: Several Short Sentences about Writing
---

The main Thesis of the book is that, when writing, you should focus on sentences, that’s your building block so if you take care of sentences, they’ll take care of the rest . 

**Some Important points**
* Long sentences often hide messy thinking.
* Meaning is only one aspect of the sentence. Get acquainted with all the others, such as rhythm and form.
* You shouldn’t worry about Style, it will come out on its own. Focus on clarity instead. [[Style and writing]]
* You don’t think, then write. You write to know what you’re thinking. [[Thinking and writing]]
* Writing is a never ending exercise in self-authorization [[Authority and writing]], everything other than that is an excuse or a place to hide. Cf. [[The practice]]

**Tactics**
* Eliminate transitions and useless repetitions. Don’t underestimate the reader.
* Eliminate all the words that are not essential. You can go one by one and see what the sentences looses or gains by letting go of a word.


**The naming of things**

> It’s hard to grasp the density, the specificity with which the world has been named.

Writer’s block - there’s no writers block. There’s failure to prepare, there’s forgetting to think, there’s not reading enough, there’s fearing your audience, there’s giving up on patience, there’s not learning to trust yourself, and your ability to learn, think and perceive.

Material - don’t save your material, squander it. Don’t save the best for last. You don’t know what your best or your last are.

> Avoiding what you feel you must write is as much a part of writing as discovering the things you didn’t know you could write.

Rescue - the way to recover your interest is to pay attention to the details, fix sentences, work on syntax. Your work will rescue you, and not the other way around.
