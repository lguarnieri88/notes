Title: The publicity image
---

Publicity is a language that makes one single proposal: that we transform ourselves by buying something more.

Publicity is always about the future buyer. It offers an Image of her rendered glamorous (i.e. enviable) by the product thatâ€™s being advertised. 

Publicity is about relations, not objects. The spectator is meant to envy herself as she will become. She is meant to imagine herself transformed into an object of envy of others, which will justify her loving herself.

The Publicity image is in a way the continuation of the tradition of the oil painting that corresponds to the change brought about by massification.

The [[Oil Painting]] tradition showed to the owner the possessions he had, and by doing so reaffirmed him. It was painted in the present tense, and projected those possessions to the future. The publicity image by contrast is meant to bring some dissatisfaction in the spectator-buyer and promise some ever moving future that will render him enviable.

Publicity for the working class tends to promise a personal transformation through the benefits of the product offered. Middle-class publicity tended to promise the transformation of relationships through an ensemble of products.

The truthfulness of publicity is not judged by the reality of its promises, but by their relevance to the daydreams of the spectator. (Is this image aligned with what I dream to become?)

There is another important social function of publicity and that is that is offers choice. That choice then takes the place of relevant political choice. It helps mask all the choices the consumer is not able to make.
