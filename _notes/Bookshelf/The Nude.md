Title: The Nude
---

About the tradition of the nude in European painting.

According to conventions there is a difference in the presence of men and women. Men’s presence is determined by a promise of power (of whatever form), whereas women’s presence is determined by the way she treats herself.

There is a duality in womanhood that divides a woman into the surveyor and the surveyed. She is always surveying herself because she knows she is being looked at. Thus she turns herself into an object or a sight.

There is a difference between nakedness and nudity. Being naked is being oneself, without clothes. Being nude is being looked at, It’s not the beginning of a work of art (say, a painting), but a way of seeing that the work achieves. To be naked is to be without disguise, to be nude is to have one’s skin turned into one.

The protagonist of the nude painting in the European tradition is not on the painting, it’s the spectator. The naked body stands to be displayed, for the pleasure, enjoyment or reassurance of the spectator. The bodies look to the spectator (even when there is a lover in the same picture), they are displayed in poses that have more to do with being at display than with the activities they are doing, they respond with calculated charm to the man who they imagine is looking at them. 

With few exceptions, the depicted is a woman and both the painter and spectator/owner is a man.
