Title: Ways of looking at art
---


* Seeing is less spontaneous than we tend to believe. It depends heavily on habit and convention.
* Perspective is a convention that centers everything in the eye of the beholder.
* The camera changes that tradition and makes art reproducible.
* This both gives and takes away from art.
* The meaning of paintings gets separated from the paintings themselves and the reproductions become information, that can be used, manipulated and arranged with other pieces of information like text, music, etc.
* The paintings gain a sort of religious quality, parallel to market value.
